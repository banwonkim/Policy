# My Development Philosophy
## Beginner Oriented Programming
I'm a beginner forever. Programming is a deep hole, and I see no end.

## Bottom-up & Anti Vibe Coding
Build it from the bottom. Vibe coding breaks the essence of programming.

`Vibe Coding` is not programming, it is an dishonest form of coding.

## Open source skepticism / Freeware Only
Open source today is broken. People just take and never think. I'm tired of it.
