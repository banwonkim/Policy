# My Development Philosophy
## Beginner Oriented Programming
**I'm a beginner forever.** Programming is a deep hole, and I see no end.

## Bottom-up Programming
**Build it from the bottom.** *It's extremely hard but fun.*

## Anti Vibe Coding & Cargo cult 
Agree or not, I think **Vibe coding** breaks the essence of programming. It's not programming; it's just an dishonest form of coding... I also hate forcing "Clean Code Style" rules if someone don't understand the core logic.
It makes beginner learning lazy and makes developers' potential disappear.

## Open source skepticism / Freeware Only
**Open source today is broken.** People just take and never think. I'm tired of it.
